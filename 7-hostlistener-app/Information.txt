> HostListener and HostBinding are concepts of directives.
> HostListener: If we want to capture any event of host element then we should use hostlistener. It helps to listen and handle events of host element.
    > For example: We want to perform some event (MouseOver/Click/MouseDown/MouseUp etc) on perticula div then we can use hostlistener to listen perticular event.

1. Create directive (ng g d testdirective) to add hostlistener (click/mouseover/mouseout) code.
    a. app/appDirectives/testdirective.directive.ts

2. Create home component and add two div. 
    a. Add diretive selector: [appTestdirective] on both div tags (home component) to trigger the events.
