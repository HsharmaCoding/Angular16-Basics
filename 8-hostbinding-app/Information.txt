> Hostbinding
    > We can use hostbinding in our host element to bind bind any property and attribute.
    > If we use hostbinding then we don't need to use renderer to access the element.
    > If we are not using hostbinding then we need to use renderer to access the element with hostlistener.

1. Create directive (ng g d testdirective) to add hostlistener (click/mouseover/mouseout) code.
    a. app/appDirectives/testdirective.directive.ts

2. Create home component and add two div. 
    a. Add diretive selector: [appTestdirective] on both div tags (home component) to trigger the events.

3. Here we are using Hostbinding to access the element instead of renderer.
