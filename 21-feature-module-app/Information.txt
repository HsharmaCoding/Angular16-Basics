2. Feature Module 
    a. The feature module helps to split our application into different modules. It helps to clean the app.module.ts file.
        i. For example: We have a product feature in angular application.
        ii. Instead of adding all the information in app.module.ts file, we can create a feature-specific module and then import a new module into app.module.ts.
        iii. Create a product module - products.module.ts (21-feature-module-app\src\app\product\products.module) and use this module to import product related information.
        iv. Import products.module into the app.module.ts file to make the system aware that products.module is a part of app.module.

3. Shared Module 
    a. Shared module helps to import common component/directives/pipe etc information into the different feature module.
        i. For example: We have a product feature and services feature in angular application.
        ii. Product and services both feature are using common back button for the back navigation. We can add back button component in shared module to share with product and services feature.
        iii. Create a common module: design-utility.module.ts (21-feature-module-app\src\app\appModules\design-utility.module.ts)
        iv. Import design-utility.module into the products.module and services.module to make the system aware that design-utility.module is a part of product and services feature.
